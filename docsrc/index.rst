Bayesian Optimisation for Topas
===============================

This repository integrates the open source bayesian optimisation code `Bayesian Optimisation <https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization>`_ with the monte carlo radiation transport code `TopasMC <http://www.topasmc.org/>`_, hence enabling users to apply the power of formal mathematical optimisation with the well established use cases for monte carlo modelling.

The quickest way to get started is to go through the worked examples.
