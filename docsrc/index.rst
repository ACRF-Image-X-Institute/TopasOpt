Inverse Optimisation for Topas
===============================

[This repository](https://github.com/ACRF-Image-X-Institute/TopasOpt) integrates the open source bayesian optimisation code `Bayesian Optimisation <https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization>`_ with the monte carlo radiation transport code `TopasMC <http://www.topasmc.org/>`_, hence enabling users to apply the power of formal mathematical optimisation with the well established use cases for monte carlo modelling.

To install::

   pip install TopasOpt
For help getting an appropriate environment set up, see `here <https://acrf-image-x-institute.github.io/TopasOpt/EnvironmentSetup.html>`_

The quickest way to get started is to go through the worked examples.
